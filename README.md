A 6-Day Journey of Building an E-Commerce Platform

By Areeba Muhammad Nafees

Day 1: Brainstorming & Business Concept

The hackathon kicked off with an exciting challenge: sketch out a business idea using just a pen and paper. I pitched an innovative e-commerce platform designed to enhance customer experience with seamless navigation and intuitive features. This initial brainstorming session helped lay a strong foundation for the project, setting the vision for the next steps.

Day 2: Structuring the Technical Framework
With a clear concept in mind, I shifted focus to the technical setup. My tasks included:

. Designing API endpoints for smooth backend communication.
. Structuring Sanity CMS schemas to manage products efficiently.
. Creating a development roadmap to guide the projectâ€™s execution.
. This phase was all about planning and ensuring a well-organized workflow.

Day 3: Backend Integration & Data Handling
Day three was all about connecting the dots between the backend and frontend. I worked on:

. Integrating APIs to fetch and send product data.
. Migrating product details into Sanity CMS for dynamic content management.
. Displaying real-time data on the website to ensure an interactive user experience.
. Seeing the website take shape with live data was a key milestone!

Day 4: Building the Frontend Experience
With the backend in place, I turned my attention to creating an engaging frontend interface. Key components developed included:

Product Listing & Detail pages for seamless browsing.
Functional features like Add to Cart, FAQs, Order Tracking, Checkout, Sign-In, Wishlist, and a Search Bar.
The goal was to make the platform visually appealing, interactive, and user-friendly.

Day 5: Testing & Optimization
To ensure everything worked smoothly, I dedicated this day to testing and refining the platform. My process included:

. Running tests with test IDs to catch and fix any bugs.
. Using Lighthouse performance analysis to enhance speed and efficiency.
. Generating a CSV file to document test results and performance insights.
. Performance and reliability were my top priorities at this stage.

Day 6: Deployment & Final Touches
The final day was all about polishing and launching the project. Steps included:

Deploying the fully functional Nike e-commerce website on Vercel.
. Securing sensitive data by configuring environment variables.

. Running a final PageSpeed Insights test to evaluate performance.
. Compiling a final report with all testing results and performance metrics.
. Watching the platform go live was incredibly rewarding!

Final Thoughts
This 6-day hackathon was an intense yet exciting experience that pushed my technical and creative limits. From brainstorming a simple idea to deploying a fully functional e-commerce website, the journey was a testament to the power of structured planning, problem-solving, and persistence.

Bringing this project to life in such a short timeframe was a challenge, but also an incredibly fulfilling experience.

ðŸš€ Looking forward to more such coding adventures!
